# Stock-Predictions

This is a project where Amazon's Stock Price is predicted.

2 Ways were implemented in this project.

1. **LSTMs(Long Short-Term Memory)** performed at **93.98%** Accuracy.
2. **GRU(Gated Recurrent Units)** performed at **96.44%** Accruracy.

Key difference b/w GRU and LSTM,

GRU has 2 gates that are 'Reset' and 'Update' while LSTM has 3 gates that are 'Input', 'Output' & 'Forget'.

GRU is less complex than LSTM because it has less number of gates and thus performs better.
